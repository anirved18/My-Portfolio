## Anirved Panda – React Portfolio
Portfolio website built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, using a crumpled-paper background theme and a flow chart based on your resume.

### 1. Setup and run locally

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Place your background image (the crumpled-paper photo) in a `public` folder as `bg-paper.jpg`:

   - Path: `public/bg-paper.jpg`
   - The Tailwind config maps this to the `bg-paper` utility.

3. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to view the portfolio.
